## Hi there 👩🏽‍💻

Welcome to my GitHub Portfolio!  I'm Krislyn Vaz, a Master’s student in Business Analytics with a background in Computer Engineering and a passion for using data to uncover insights and drive smarter decision-making.

Each project includes real-world datasets and demonstrates techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, SQL querying, and data visualization using tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn), SQL, Tableau and Excel. Whether analyzing customer behavior, evaluating business performance, or exploring trends in sports and entertainment, I aim to turn raw data into actionable stories.

Feel free to explore the folders and check out the code, visualizations, and insights. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration!
